# Fran López

Software Developer based in the Canary Islands. Computer Engineering graduate from the Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.

I work across the full stack — from databases and APIs to frontend interfaces — with a focus on cloud infrastructure, containerization, and automation. Most of my professional experience revolves around building and maintaining web applications, managing deployments with Docker, and setting up CI/CD pipelines that keep things running smoothly.

**Tech I work with:** PHP, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, Python, C#, AWS, Docker, MySQL, PostgreSQL.

I'm always happy to connect — whether it's to collaborate on a project, talk shop, or just say hi.
